# Opofinance Support Dashboard

## 🧭 Introduction

The Opofinance Support Dashboard is a modern, scalable frontend application designed to streamline support operations. It provides a unified interface for managing tickets, live chats, clients, and performance metrics with a strong focus on usability, performance, and extensibility.

This project is currently implemented as a **frontend-only (consumer) system**, but its architecture allows seamless integration with backend services and APIs.

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Current Architecture (Frontend Only)

* Static SPA-like structure (Single Page Application behavior)
* Modular JavaScript architecture
* Component-based UI separation (via CSS & JS modules)

### Future Architecture (Scalable Design)

* Backend integration (REST APIs)
* Authentication service (JWT / OAuth)
* Real-time updates (WebSockets)

---

## ⚙️ Core Modules

### 1. Authentication Module

* Login & Signup UI
* Extendable for backend authentication
* Prepared for token-based systems

### 2. Dashboard Module

* Displays key performance indicators:

  * Open Tickets
  * Resolved Tickets
  * Response Time
  * CSAT Score
* Animated counters (incremental rendering)

### 3. Navigation Module

* Sidebar-based navigation system
* SPA behavior (no page reload)
* Active state management

### 4. Charts Module

* Data visualization powered by Chart.js
* Animated rendering from zero state
* Easily replaceable with dynamic API data

### 5. UI/UX Module

* Modern design system (Purple / Blue / Black palette)
* Micro-interactions & hover effects
* Responsive layout system

### 6. Theme System

* Light / Dark mode toggle
* Centralized theme control via CSS classes

### 7. Internationalization (i18n)

* Dual-language support:

  * English (LTR)
  * Persian (RTL)
* Dynamic text replacement using `data-*` attributes

## 🔌 Functional Breakdown

### 🔢 Animated Counters

All metric values are initialized at `0` and increment dynamically to their final values using JavaScript logic.

### 📊 Chart Rendering

Charts are initialized using Chart.js and animated on load.

### 🔄 Page Switching

* Implemented without full reload
* Controlled via DOM class toggling
* Improves performance and UX

### 🌙 Theme Engine

* Controlled through `theme.js`
* Applies global class (`theme-dark` / `theme-light`) to `<body>`

### 🌍 Language Engine

* Uses `data-en` and `data-fa`
* Dynamically swaps content
* Switches layout direction (LTR ↔ RTL)

---

## 🧪 Extensibility & Scalability

### Ready for Backend Integration:

* Replace static data with API responses
* Add authentication layer (JWT)
* Integrate database-driven content

### Suggested Enhancements:

* Real-time updates (WebSockets)
* Role-based access control (RBAC)
* Notification system
* Error handling layer

---

## 📡 API Design (Future Implementation)

If the project evolves into a **provider system**, APIs should follow REST principles:

### Example Endpoints:

```id="api1"
GET    /api/tickets
POST   /api/tickets
GET    /api/clients
GET    /api/performance
```

### Response Format:

```json id="api2"
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": [],
  "message": ""
}
```

## 🛠️ Technologies

* HTML5
* CSS3 (Modular Architecture)
* JavaScript (ES6+)
* Chart.js
* Google Fonts

---

## 🚀 Deployment

### GitHub Pages

Ensure correct structure:

* Use relative paths (`./css/...`, `./js/...`)
* All assets must exist in repository

### Local Development

Simply open `index.html` in browser

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

* No backend integration yet
* Static/mock data
* No authentication logic implemented

---

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

* Simplicity over complexity
* Modular and maintainable structure
* Scalable for future backend integration
* Clean and modern UI/UX

---

## 📌 Conclusion

This project demonstrates a production-ready frontend dashboard architecture that can evolve into a fully functional support system with backend integration.

It is suitable as a foundation for SaaS dashboards, admin panels, and customer support platforms.
